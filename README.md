# Azuser - Azure SQL Server User Management

![Azuser](https://github.com/Inzanit/azuser/blob/master/.resources/ReadMeIntro.gif?raw=true)

## ðŸŽ‰ The port to .NET Core is underway! This project is being revived, and all developmental work is being done on the `master` branch.

## Motivation

Pronounced As-user, Azuser eliminates the need for using a command line interface to manage SQL Server users and logins. It is currently not possible to easily manage users for databases through a GUI like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - user management is achieved through the CLI with verbose options to configure users' roles for a given database. Azuser is a lightweight desktop application written in WPF, aimed at completely removing the need for any command line interface, ensuring database users have and get the right access.

## What does it do

- Add, edit and drop logins from your SQL Server database
- Add, edit and drop users for logins from your SQL Server database

Azuser automatically manages users for logins on your server.

**Azuser works for both Azure and non-Azure SQL Server databases.**

## Stack

Azuser is split into two projects, the desktop client and the database management project.

The desktop client is written in WPF, using the MVVM architecture, targeting .NET Framework 4.7, using C#7. A number of small, reliable, dependencies have been added:

- [Mahapps Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for styling and controls
- [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) for logging

The second project, `Azuser.Services` is where the magic happens. This project targets .NET Standard 2.0 and is fully capable of standing alone, without the desktop client. This project has no dependencies other than the .NET libraries for the SQL client.
